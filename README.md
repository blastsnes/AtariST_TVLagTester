# Atari ST Video Lag Tester
Quick tool to analyse the input lag of a TV / Monitor from a real Atari ST or FPGA.

A zip containing the Atari ST disk image (.ST file format) can be dowloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/blastsnes/AtariST_TVLagTester/releases/tag/v1.0) section.
Mount this disk image with your MiSTer FPGA or create a real floppy from it and load into your Atari ST (pure old school way!).

Please take a look at the screen capture below which includes a short documentation:
